# FFXIV Auto Angler

A python tool to automate fishing in FFXIV using only information available on the monitor.

It was made as a personal challenge and learning exercise, and is not intended for use.

It -

- Parses the chat log via OCR.
- Recognises the light on the fishing rod and notes any sudden changes in its position.
- Can emulate keyboard/mouse events.

## TODO
-[ ] Connect the current functionality up to actually fish.
